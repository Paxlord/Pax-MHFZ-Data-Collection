# Pax-MHFZ-Data-Collection
This repository is aiming to be a collection of data that I have mapped in this game. 
It's been pretty hard to find nicely-formatted accurate data about a multiple of things in this game. So I hope this repo can help people that wants to create tools around MHFZ find what they're looking for.

Data schemas will be refined over time and I'll slowly push through my backlog and upload more data as I come across it in my different projects

If you have any suggestion about data-formatting, feel free to raise an issue or shoot me a DM on Discord at @pax_777
