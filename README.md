# Pax-MHFZ-Data-Collection
This repository is aiming to be a collection of data that I have mapped in this game. 
It's been pretty hard to find nicely-formatted accurate data about a lot of things related to this game. I hope this repo can help people that wants to create tools around MHFZ to find what they're looking for.

Data schemas will be refined over time as I mapped currently unknown values and I'll slowly push through my backlog and upload more data as I come across it in my different projects.

If you have any suggestions about data-formatting, feel free to raise an issue or shoot me a DM on Discord at @pax_777
